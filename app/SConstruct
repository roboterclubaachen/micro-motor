# So you want to add or remove compile options?
#   0. Check what options you want to add to GCC:
#      https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Option-Summary.html
#   1. Check what the environment variables are called in SCons:
#      https://www.scons.org/doc/latest/HTML/scons-user/apa.html
#   2. You can append one or multiple options like this
#       env.Append(CCFLAGS="-pedantic")
#       env.Append(CCFLAGS=["-pedantic", "-pedantic-errors"])
#   3. If you need to remove options, you need to do this:
#       env["CCFLAGS"].remove("-pedantic")
#      Note that a lot of options also have a "-no-{option}" option
#      that may overwrite previous options.
#   4. Add your environment changes below these instructions
#      inside this SConstruct file.
#   5. COMMIT THIS SCONSTRUCT FILE NOW!
#   6. Tell lbuild not to overwrite this SConstruct file anymore:
#       <option name="modm:build:scons:include_sconstruct">False</option>
#   7. Anyone using your project now also benefits from your environment changes.
